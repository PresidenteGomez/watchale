            One of the biggest problems in Minneapolis and around the Country is the lack of a centralized system to protect our immigrant
            communities from being separated and deported from their families. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
            agents lurk in our local communities and dismantle families from each other. These “ICE raids” are incredibly
            disruptive to communities. The application’s goal is to encourage neighbors to report ICE sightings, so families
            have the opportunity to stay together. Keeping our communities safe is the most important goal of this application.
